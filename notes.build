##
## After downloading the git repository, issuing the following
## 3 commands will set and rebase the current git repository
## with the master SVN repository.

git svn init https://advants.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/advants
git update-ref refs/remotes/git-svn refs/remotes/origin/master
git svn rebase


## Then one can use this as they would a normal git repository
## using the following commands to acheive syncronization with
## the master SVN

## 1) rebase current branch on top of master svn:
##   git svn rebase

## 2) Once you are happy with the git based topic, push each of the current patch sets to the svn master as separate commits:
##  git svn dcommit
