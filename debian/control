Description: advanced normalization tools for brain and image analysis
 Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTS) is an ITK-based suite of
 normalization, segmentation and template-building tools for
 quantitative morphometric analysis. Many of the ANTS registration
 tools are diffeomorphic, but deformation (elastic and BSpline)
 transformations are available. Unique components of ANTS include
 multivariate similarity metrics, landmark guidance, the ability to
 use label images to guide the mapping and both greedy and space-time
 optimal implementations of diffeomorphisms. The symmetric
 normalization (SyN) strategy is a part of the ANTS toolkit as is
 directly manipulated free form deformation (DMFFD).
