ants (1.9+svn532-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Disable lengthy _SYN unittest to allow pass on slow archs (like sparc)
    (Closes: #594133). Added few other reasonably fast tests

ants (1.9+svn532-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cherry picking rev 581,589-590 from upstream to assure correct application
    of transformation while operating on 4D timeseries (Closes: #588195)

ants (1.9+svn532-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Placing all binaries and scripts under /usr/lib/ants, since many
    scripts rely on binaries to be in the same directory, and ftp-master
    raised concern about some names for the binaries.  ANTS binary only gets
    symlinked under /usr/bin
  * Initial Debian release (Closes: #579569)
  * Added fsl and gridengine-client into suggests
