    Builds fine with ITK 3.20 (Closes: #614483)

    (/usr/lib/ants) and do not override with hardcode custom upstream paths
    (Closes: #636529)

ants (1.9+svn532-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Placing all binaries and scripts under /usr/lib/ants, since many

  * Initial Debian release (Closes: #579569)
