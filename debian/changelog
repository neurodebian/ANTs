ants (1.9.2+svn680.dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Seems to build fine now against available ITK 3.20 (Closes: #655306)
  * Boosting policy to 3.9.3 (no changes)
  * Version ITK build-depends >= 3.16~
  * Placed build PATH ahead of system wide during tests so proper version
    of ants gets tested on systems with ants installed
  * (Temporarily) added a bulk of build-depends for wrapper bindings for
    vtk >= 5.8 to overcome #584300

  * Upload to unstable version from experimental (forgotten there).
    Builds fine with ITK 3.20 (Closes: #614483)
  * New patch deb_antspath -- use default path on Debian systems
    (/usr/lib/ants) and do not override with hardcode custom upstream paths
    (Closes: #636529)
  * Boosting policy to 3.9.2 (no changes)

ants (1.9+svn532-5) unstable; urgency=low

ants (1.9+svn532-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moving under NeuroDebian umbrella
  * Absorbed commits from upstream:
    - avoid division by 0 in progress meter (Closes: #586915)

ants (1.9+svn532-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Placing all binaries and scripts under /usr/lib/ants, since many
    scripts rely on binaries to be in the same directory, and ftp-master

    symlinked under /usr/bin
  * Initial Debian release (Closes: #579569)
  * Added fsl and gridengine-client into suggests
