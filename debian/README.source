ANTS for Debian
---------------

Source package is built out of SVN source tree (cloned via git-svn) to
facilitate easier adoption of upstream patches and release of
snapshots if necessary.

Unfortunately components/copyright information of the Documentation/ is
not cleared up, so they are excluded from Debian release of ANTs.
